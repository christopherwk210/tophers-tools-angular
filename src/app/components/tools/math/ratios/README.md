# [Ratiomatic](https://chrisanselmo.com/tools/#/math/ratiomatic)

When designing UI for various applications, I often found myself needing to figure out various whole-number scaled values for given proportions. I made this tool to satisfy that need. It allows you to enter a ratio (i.e. 1920/1080) and it will provide you with every whole number simplification of that proportion. In addition, you can input new numbers to get the approapriate numerator/denominator to go with it based on the original ratio.

Implemented based on my [original project](https://github.com/christopherwk210/ratiomatic).
