# GML JavaDoc Gen

Quickly turn GameMaker: Studio script comments into GameMaker Studio 2 compatible JavaDoc comments. This is useful for users who are just migrating from GMS 1.X to GMS 2.X, as GMS 2 changed the way script hinting works from single comment lines to JavaDoc-ish script headers.

Implemented based on my [original project](https://github.com/christopherwk210/gml-javadoc-gen).
